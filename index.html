        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <div class="overflow-auto" style="height: 360px;">

            <p>Let’s pickup my story from my junior year of College. I was working on my Bachelor's in Finance at Pace
                University, NYC and landed a position with Morgan Stanley's Equity Derivatives Group. My
                responsibilities included overseeing processes that calculated options valuation, profit/loss, and
                portfolio risk; then reporting those results. Morgan Stanley had a different proprietary program to
                perform each of those tasks. The underlying data and calculations were a mystery to me, but everything
                on the reporting end came from Excel spreadsheets that I managed and it was there that I got my first
                taste of programming.
            <p>I worked with a brilliant junior analyst who had built some nifty functionalities into Excel with
                VBA. Once he showed me that Developer tab I was hooked. We were soon moved to different teams but I
                would constantly pester him with questions and eventually started tinkering with the VBA code.
            <p>I graduated in 2008, and in that year Morgan Stanley went thru the biggest crisis they ever
                faced. They were unable to give me a competitive offer and it did not take long for me to find a
                very attractive position at a hedge fund in Stamford, CT. Before leaving Morgan Stanley I had
                the pleasure of meeting the Director in charge of their automated options trading desk (someone
                who would always receive my reports but that I never actually met in person). What was supposed
                to be a 10 minute goodbye turned into an hour long conversation once I saw his computer screen
                and asked what were those cryptic sentence fragments all about. That was the first time I laid
                my eye on “real” computer code (probably python). Side note: that day he also told me that all
                you need to know to do his job [besides coding] is in <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/Option-Volatility-Pricing-Strategies-Techniques/dp/155738486X">this
                    book.</a>
            <p>Diamondback Capital was multi-billion dollar multi strategy long/short hedge fund. If you had
                all your money invested with them in 2008-2009 you would not have been disappointed with
                your returns. While banks were shutting down, they were hiring across the board. My position
                there was very similar to my analyst position at MS: collect data, reconcile data, report
                data. But at Diamondback my team did not have the luxury of dedicated programmers handling
                data collection and maintenance with sophisticated databases and proprietary systems. It was
                my responsibility to manage all the data day to day using mostly Excel (auditors would make
                sure we weren’t misreporting anything once a month, the dreaded month-end process).
            <p>It was there that I took my VBA skills to another level, mostly out of an insatiable
                desire to make every process more efficient. After a few months, I was able to reduce
                the time it took to reconcile the previous day’s P&L from 4 hours to 2. My manager
                noticed the improvement when he saw me having lunch at 11am one day, and he promptly
                gave me more responsibilities to fill the idle time. After 1 year working there, I was
                training someone to take over my day to day responsibilities and moving on to work on
                bigger projects within the firm. Diamondback eventually shut down, after that I held
                positions in different firms. But the story was always the same, I would leave things
                better than I found them.
            <p>Then in 2015 I was offered the position of Director of Operations for a hedge fund in
                Florida. That is the highest position in the Operations department of hedge funds.
                By that point I was a bit removed from the day to day processes. My goal was still
                to improve them but now it mostly involved things like hiring the right people and
                looking into different systems. I was no longer coding daily (I would occasionally
                teach VBA to junior colleagues).
            <p>I realized then that the most satisfying part of the job for me was being faced
                with a difficult problem, coming up with an elegant solution for it, and then
                getting my hands dirty implementing it. Around that time I started looking into
                Computer Science programs but could not find one that would fit into my busy
                schedule.
            <p>Then, like all good things, the Director position came to an abrupt end after
                I had a major disagreement with the other managers at the fund. I left
                Florida and lived in Hawaii for two years, where I spent my time surfing,
                reading, taking free online courses and pondering about the next stage of my
                life…
            <p>I am not even sure how I came across the online post-bacc Computer
                Science program from Oregon State, but it took me exactly 24 hours from
                the time I first read the curriculum to when I made the decision to
                embark on this journey.
